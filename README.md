# Cache
My realisation lfu and perfect caches

## Overview
In this project, I have realised two algorithms of caching:

1) LFU (Last Frequently Used)

2) Perfect Cache: In this cache, the element that is furthest away in the input stream or is missing from it is evicted

## Build

`cmake CMakeLists.txt
`make

to start the LFU cache:
`./lfu_cache

to start the perfect cache:
`./prf_cache
